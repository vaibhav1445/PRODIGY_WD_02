HTML Structure:
Title and Container: The web app begins with a title and a container div to hold the stopwatch display and control buttons.
Stopwatch Display: Inside the container, a div or span element displays the stopwatch time (initially set to 00:00:00).
Control Buttons: Buttons to control the stopwatch functionality:
Start Button: Initiates or resumes the stopwatch.
Stop Button: Pauses the stopwatch.
Reset Button: Resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00.
CSS Styling:
Container Styling: Centered alignment, margin for spacing.
Stopwatch Display Styling: Styling for the display area, possibly larger font size for visibility.
Control Button Styling: Styling for buttonsâ€”differentiating styles for start, stop, and reset buttons.
JavaScript Functionality:
Variables: Maintain variables to store stopwatch state, such as time elapsed (in milliseconds), interval ID for the running timer, and flags to track if the stopwatch is running or stopped.
Event Listeners: Attach click event listeners to the control buttons.
Start Button Functionality: When clicked, initiate a setInterval function to update the stopwatch display every millisecond (or second) and start the stopwatch.
Stop Button Functionality: When clicked, stop the setInterval function, effectively pausing the stopwatch.
Reset Button Functionality: When clicked, reset the stopwatch time to 00:00:00 and clear the interval, resetting the stopwatch to its initial state.
Stopwatch Logic:
Start Function: Capture the current time when the start button is clicked and continuously update the display by calculating the elapsed time.
Stop Function: Stop the timer interval when the stop button is clicked, pausing the stopwatch display.
Reset Function: Reset the elapsed time and display back to 00:00:00 when the reset button is clicked.
